# Tiffany Cheng Maker Portfolio

Hi!! Welcome to my portfolio! 
Apart from research, I believe doing projects is an excellent way to learn. 

I personally have learnt many things from different subject ideas by 
1. discovering topic I'm interested in
2. think of a project idea related to said topic
3. do the project

I've chosen a couple of projects/programs that could showcase how I grew as a learner and maker, 
and the wide range of interests I have. 
I try to learn whatever which piques my interest, but I aim to always bring ideas to life.

Below is the list of projects in this portfolio:<br/>

## ðŸ’» Programming <br/>
### 1. Finanical Notes Valuation (Completed) <br/>
   * Code: [![Open In Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-F9AB00?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlecolab&color=525252)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zEJ9py69bVLPH2RoiwW_WafufVH_jT-m?usp=sharing)
   [![Open In Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](Financial-Notes-Valuation.ipynb)<br/>
   * Video Walkthrough: [![Open In YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-FF0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://youtu.be/5X7I4LxD7TQ)<br/>
   * Code Snippet: The source code only has two main sections, 1. the initial program and 2. the refactored version. They do the exact same thing, except the latter is written with slight more sophistication, under more experience. May I refer you to section 2 for viewing code functionality, to section 1 for some very funny code, and to both section for growth observation. <br/><br/>
   
   
   
### 2. Neural Network Optimization (Almost Completed, I got stuck in deployment)<br/>
   * Code: [![Open In Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-F9AB00?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlecolab&color=525252)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qtjOgTuTskXLaKGdSHz88TgKX2r_Tlux?usp=sharing)
   [![Open In Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](Neural-Network-Quantization.ipynb)<br/>
   * Video Walkthrough: [![Open In YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-FF0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://youtu.be/MY_YlnFXgYs)
   * Code Snippet: <br/>
       * The dataloader took the most thought and gave me to most issues, but in the process allowed me to understand much more on how image and annotation processing works. Opensource datasets do not work right out the box sometimes.
         <br/> (Cell denoted: In [14] in the [Github version](Neural-Network-Quantization.ipynb), or view it on Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qtjOgTuTskXLaKGdSHz88TgKX2r_Tlux#scrollTo=6SUH8hLwC-1i&line=11&uniqifier=1), 
       * But the part where I designed classes to configure activation and weights using custom observers is a personal touch and reference to my research, which is pretty cool too.

### 3. Webpage, AI-Driven Language Learning App (In Progress)<br/>
   * Application Demo: [![Open In YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-FF0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://youtu.be/8ZCzbbDSofM)
