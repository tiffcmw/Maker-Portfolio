# Maker-Portfolio

Hi!! Welcome to my portfolio! 
Apart from research, I believe doing projects is an excellent way to learn. 

I personally have learnt many things from different subject ideas by 
1. discovering topic I'm interested in
2. think of a project idea related to said topic
3. do the project

I've chosen a couple of projects/programs that could showcase how I grew as a learner and maker, 
and the wide range of interests I have. I try to learn whatever which piques my interest :)

The complexities of the projects range from
- simple Python calculation scripts to neural network optimizatioms, 
- Figma design to Fullstack development,
- Sketches to schematic designs and hardware, 

I have no idea what the next thing would be but many things are fascinating to me. 
I hope to always bring ideas to life.
