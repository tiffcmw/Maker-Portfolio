# Tiffany Cheng Maker Portfolio

Hi!! Welcome to my portfolio! 
Apart from research, I believe doing projects is an excellent way to learn. 

I personally have learnt many things from different subject ideas by 
1. discovering topic I'm interested in
2. think of a project idea related to said topic
3. do the project

I've chosen a couple of projects/programs that could showcase how I grew as a learner and maker, 
and the wide range of interests I have. 
I try to learn whatever which piques my interest, but I aim to always bring ideas to life. 

Below is the list of projects in this portfolio:
